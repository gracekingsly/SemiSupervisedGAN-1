# SemiSupervisedGAN

Modern machine learning is data intensive in nature. However, not all applications
are appropriate enough to supply sufficient data. This study compares the
performance of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) against different dataset
by setting the number of real input data as a control variable. In addition, based
on the result the study trains the generator with feature matching. This forces the
discriminator to learn features of the labeled set which match with the features of
the generated samples, thereby reducing over-fitting to labeled set.
